          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Architects are professionals who are trained to design and plan
            buildings, spaces, and other physical structures. They typically
            work in a variety of settings, including private firms, government
            agencies, and non-profit organizations. Architects must have a
            strong understanding of mathematics, engineering, and design
            principles, as well as excellent communication and problem-solving
            skills. They may specialize in different types of architecture, such
            as residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, or focus on
            specific areas like sustainability or historic preservation. In
            addition to their technical skills, architects must also be creative
            and able to think outside the box to come up with innovative
            solutions to design challenges. They must also be able to work
            effectively with a variety of stakeholders, from clients and
            contractors to government officials and community members.
